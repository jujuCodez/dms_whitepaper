## 1. Introduction: The Need for Driver Monitoring

### 1.1 The Road Safety Imperative  
Global road safety statistics consistently point to driver fatigue, inattention, and distraction as major causes of accidents. Regulatory bodies and insurers are increasingly emphasizing advanced driver-assistance technologies. Within this context, a robust Driver Monitoring System addresses:

- **Fatigue and Drowsiness**: Identifying early signs (e.g., micro-sleeps, prolonged eye closure).  
- **Distracted Driving**: Detecting phone usage, seat position changes, or extended glances away from the road.  
- **Emotional Stress**: Analyzing driver stress or anger that may impair judgment.

### 1.2 Emerging Market Momentum  
Recent research suggests a steady growth trajectory for DMS solutions. In the passenger car segment, regulatory frameworks like the European Commission’s General Safety Regulation are making driver monitoring mandatory for new vehicle models, while commercial fleet operators see DMS as critical for risk management. Additionally, innovations in AI and edge computing have made real-time in-cabin analytics viable at scale.
